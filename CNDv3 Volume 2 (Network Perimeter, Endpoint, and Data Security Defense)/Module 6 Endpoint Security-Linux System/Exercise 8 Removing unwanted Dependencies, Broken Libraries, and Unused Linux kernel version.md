### Summary of Steps for Removing Unwanted Dependencies, Broken Libraries, and Unused Linux Kernel Versions

1. **Launch Smoothwall Firewall VM**: Log in with the password `toor`.
2. **Wait for Smoothwall to Load**: Allow the Smoothwall login screen to appear.
3. **Launch AD Domain Controller VM**: Log in as `CND\Administrator` with password `Pa$$w0rd`.
4. **Click Yes on Network Screen**: If the Server Manager Dashboard appears, close it.
5. **Launch Operation Dept VM**: Log in as `Alice` with password `user@123`.
6. **Open Terminal**: Right-click on the desktop and select "Open in Terminal."
7. **Switch to Root User**: Type `sudo su` and enter the password `user@123`.
8. **Update System Packages**: Run the command:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```
9. **Upgrade System**: Execute:
   ```
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```
   Confirm with `Y` if prompted.
10. **Clean Local Repository**: Run:
    ```
    apt-get autoclean
    ```
11. **Check Current Kernel Version**: Verify the running kernel version with:
    ```
    uname -mrs
    ```
12. **List All Kernel Images**: Type the command:
    ```
    dpkg --list | egrep -i 'linux-image*|linux-header*'
    ```
13. **Remove Unwanted Packages**: Execute:
    ```

    apt-get purge linux-image-6.2.0-39-generic
    ```
    Confirm with `Y` if prompted.
15. **Verify Remaining Kernel Images**: Check the list of kernel images again:
    ```
    dpkg --list | egrep -i 'linux-image*|linux-header*'
    ```

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively remove unwanted dependencies, broken packages, and old kernel images from your Linux system. This process enhances system performance, optimizes disk space, reduces maintenance complexity, and improves overall security and stability. Regular maintenance, including kernel management, is essential for a secure and efficient Linux environment.
