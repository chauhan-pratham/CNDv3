### Summary of Steps for Analyzing Security Configuration Baseline Using Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (MSCT)

1. **Launch VMs**: Start the Smoothwall Firewall and AD Domain Controller VMs. Log in to both using the provided credentials.

2. **Extract MSCT Files**:
   - Navigate to `Z:\CNDv3 Module 05 Endpoint Security-Windows Systems\MSCT`.
   - Right-click on `MSCT.zip` and select "Extract Here." Copy the extracted folder to `C:\`.
   - Extract `PolicyAnalyzer.zip` in the same manner.

3. **Download Security Baseline**:
   - Download the latest version of the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit from [Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
   - Extract the `Windows 10 Version 1809` and `Windows Server 2019 Security Baseline.zip` files to a designated folder.

4. **Open Policy Analyzer**:
   - Navigate to `C:\MSCT\PolicyAnalyzer\PolicyAnalyzer_40` and run `PolicyAnalyzer.exe`.
   - Click "Add.." and select GPO folders by navigating to `C:\MSCT\Windows 10 Version 1809 and Windows Server 2019 Security Baseline\GPOs`.

5. **Import and Save Policies**:
   - Click "Import" to load the GPOs into the Policy Analyzer.
   - Save the imported policy rules as `MicrosoftSecurityBaseline_for_WinServer22`.

6. **Compare Policies**:
   - Check "Compare local registry" and "Local policy" checkboxes, then click "View/Compare."
   - In the Policy Viewer, select "Show only Conflicts" from the View menu to analyze discrepancies between current GPO settings and Microsoft-recommended settings.

7. **Review Conflicts**: Scroll through the conflict entries to identify overlaps and potential security issues.

8. **Close Windows**: Exit all open windows in the AD Domain Controller VM.

By following these steps, network defenders can effectively analyze and manage security configurations using the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit.
