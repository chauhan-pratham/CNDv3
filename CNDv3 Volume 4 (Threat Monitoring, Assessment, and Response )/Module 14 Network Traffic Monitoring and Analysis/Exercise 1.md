# Capturing Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Lab Scenario
Network traffic contains various data packets that require proper analysis. Wireshark, a powerful network packet analyzer, simplifies this task with its graphical interface for easier sorting and filtering of network data. This guide outlines the steps to capture network traffic using Wireshark.

## Lab Objectives
- Launch firewall VMs for network configuration
- Capture network traffic using Wireshark

## Steps to Capture Network Traffic

### Step 1: Launch Firewall Machines
1. **PfSense Firewall:**
   - Click the **PfSense Firewall** link to launch the VM.
   - If the machine is inactive, press **Enter** to activate it.

2. **Smoothwall Firewall:**
   - Click the **Smoothwall Firewall** link to launch the VM.
   - Enter the password as `toor` and press **Enter**.
   - Press the **Tab** key twice to navigate to the **Done** button and press **Enter**.
   - Wait for the Smoothwall Firewall to load successfully.

### Step 2: Launch Admin Machine
1. Click **AdminMachine-1** to launch the AdminMachine VM.
2. Click the **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** link to proceed with the login.
3. Enter the following credentials:
   - **Username:** `Admin`
   - **Password:** `admin@123`
4. Click **Enter** to log in.

5. If a **Network** window appears, click **Yes**.
6. If the **Letâ€™s finish setting up your PC** window appears, click **Remind me later**.

### Step 4: Start Capturing Network Traffic
1. In the Wireshark main window, select the interface you wish to monitor (e.g., **Ethernet 2**).
2. Click the **Start Capturing Packets** button (blue shark fin icon) from the toolbar.
3. If a **Wireshark Update** popup appears, click **Remind me later**.

Wireshark will begin capturing network traffic from the selected interface.
