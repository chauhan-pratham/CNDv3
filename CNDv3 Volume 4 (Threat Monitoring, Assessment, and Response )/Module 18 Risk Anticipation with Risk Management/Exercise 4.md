# Application Vulnerability Scanning using OWASP ZAP

## Overview
OWASP ZAP is an open-source security tool for detecting web application vulnerabilities. This guide explains how to perform a vulnerability scan using OWASP ZAP.

## Lab Setup
1. **Launch VMs:**
   - Start **Web Server VM** (Login: `Administrator / admin@123`).
   - Start **AdminMachine-1 VM** (Login: `admin@123`).
2. Allow the "PC discoverable" prompt by selecting **Yes** if prompted.

## OWASP ZAP Configuration
